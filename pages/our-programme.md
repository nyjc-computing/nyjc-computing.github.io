## Our Approach
At NYJC, we take a hands-on approach to learning. Computing students will learn the syllabus topics through a variety of programming exercises that keep the focus on gaining programming experience. We then use this experience as an anchor for the theoretical principles that improve their programming.

## Learning Tracks

Students who wish to push themselves beyond the H2 Computing syllabus have three (optional) tracks of development available to them.

### Competitive Programming

Students develop their knowledge and mastery of algorithms and data structures through:
- Courses conducted by NUS CeNCE
- Training provided by the NY Robotics and Computer Science CCA (NYRCS) and the NY Competitive Programming SIG (NYCP)
- Learning from seniors and alumni in our nyjc_computing Discord server
- The National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI)

### Cybersecurity

Students develop their knowledge of computer security vulnerabilities and mitigations through:
- A variety of hackathons organised by NUS, NTU, and SMU
- Cyberthon, Brainhack, and various events organised by CSIT, DSTA, and other government cybersecurity agencies
- The Sentinel Programme, organised by DIS
- Training provided by NYRCS

### Application Development

Students develop their ability to design an application system, lead and be part of a software engineering team, and manage stakeholder goals through:
- Programming projects, self-initiated or selected from an available pool
- Collaborations with other CCAS and SIGs
- VIA projects that benefit the college and/or community
- Ongoing mentorship with experienced tutors to learn and experience industry best practices
