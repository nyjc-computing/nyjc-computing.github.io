## Advice from seniors

Just start doing projects and writing scripts as early as possible in whatever you're even momentarily interested in so that you can not only apply and recall the lessons but also learn new things outside of the classroom.  
Actual real-world projects are probably the best way to do well for exams as well as learn about programming in general.  
For paper 1, just memorise, most of the ans are very standard, for example difference between validation and verification, it comes out all the time but the ans is always the same."  
Your computing results do not reflect how good of a programmer you are, when looking beyond the syllabus. I think what’s more important is your willingness to learn new things every day.  
Work on external projects to help familiarise yourself with the programming language.

it gets very hard at first but it gets better over time, enjoy the process!  
Practice what you have learnt and apply it into real world projects  
Spend time developing your understanding and programming "toolkits", and probably know the updated/modern programming practices outside of the Computing course (the syllabus isn't too good in teaching this aspect... who uses f.close() after a file context manager anyways?). Other than that, look into working on a project using OOP. Once you do, that's probably half of the techniques in the syllabus (bonus points if Java is already one of your languages).  

This subject is slightly different from other school subjects which is hard to find online ans, i realised i can never find ans for chem or to learn chem online due to different exam syllabus, for computing, there are various online schools to teach you coding, w3school and tutorialpoint are good websites for beginners like yall, other than that you can find codes that are easier to learn than the ones that teachers teach you. Oh and dont forget, stackoverflow is your best friend from the moment you take computing. Other than that, its all about hands on experience, other than math, this is prob the only subject that you can score high just by practising over and over again, getting familiar with the coding habits is very important.  

Don't stress too hard, the papers are easier than you think they are, especially paper 1. you don't need to go around doing tons of other school prelim papers and what not. Don't stress over minor details and specific answers for a single question that is unlikely to come out. Practice makes perfect for paper 2   
keep practicing ur coding (no need daily la but at least once per week ya jus code any sorting algo/website/whatever u want) if not you’ll 200% regret on the day of ur A Level Practical don’t spot questions the syllabus is still new. computing content isn’t as jialat as other sciences so be grateful and study everything  


for practical: do more practices and ACTUALLY understand what u are coding instead of focusing on output only also dont look at a question and assume u know how to do everything with no problems, at least write out the rough structure of the code to keep ur thinking process sharp AND make sure to actually code it out frequently to ensure no dumb mistakes are made  
for theory: expect that the theory answers change from question to question but ensure ur basis of understanding is there so that proper answers can still be made even if context very unfamiliar  

There are many past year prelim papers on holy grail Google drive to prepare for A level papers.  
Do past year papers to prepare and do brainscape regularly  
Do not overlook theory content  
Try to score as much for Paper 2 as possible. It gives you a lot of leeway for Paper 1 if you can score around 90 for Paper 2.
