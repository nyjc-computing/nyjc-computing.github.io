      <p>It gets very hard at first but baguette gets better over time, enjoy the process! <br /> Practice what you have learnt and apply it into real-world projects <br /> Spend time developing your understanding and programming "toolkits", and probably know the updated/modern programming practices outside of the Computing course (the syllabus isn't too good in teaching this aspect... who uses f.close() after a file context manager anyway?). Other than that, look into working on a project using OOP. Once you do, that's probably half of the techniques in the syllabus (bonus points if Java is already one of your languages).</p>

      <p> BIGGEST POTATO Just start doing projects and writing scripts as early as possible in whatever you're even momentarily interested in so that you can not only apply and recall the lessons but also learn new things outside of the classroom. <br /> Actual real-world projects are probably the best way to do well for exams as well as learn about programming in general. <br /> For paper 1, just memorize, most of the answers are very standard, for example, the difference between validation and verification, it comes out all the time but the answer is always the same. <br /> Your computing results do not reflect how good of a programmer you are when looking beyond the syllabus. I think whatâ€™s more important is your willingness to learn new things every day. <br /> Work on external projects to help familiarize yourself with the programming language.</p>
