## Do I need to take H2 Computing to study Computer Science at university?

No autonomous university in Singapore strictly requires H2 Computing for admission. That means you can apply for admission even without H2 Computing.
You can refer to the admissions websites of the universities for further information:

- [NUS](https://www.join.comp.nus.edu.sg/apply)
- [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate-programmes?listingKeyword=Computing&disciplines=engineering%7Cscience&programmelevels=single-degree%7Csingle-degree-with-2nd-major%7Cdouble-degree&programmetypes=all&page=1)
- [SMU](https://admissions.smu.edu.sg/admissions-requirements/singapore-cambridge-gce-levels)
- [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Application/Admission-Requirements/Singapore-Cambridge-GCE-A-Level)

## What is the H2 Computing A Level examination like?

The exam syllabus for all A level subjects can be found on SEAB's website. The current syllabus for H2 Computing is 9569.

There are two papers. Paper 1 is a 3-hr written paper. Paper 2 is a 3-hr lab-based paper, administered digitally on a laptop. The code files/submissions are uploaded via an electronic system at the end of the exam.

## Why would I want to take H2 Computing as a subject?

H2 Computing is not required for admission to any university degree programme. In the JAE system, it also counts as a science stream subject.

Hence, most students in NYJC who take Computing are either firmly determined to take a Math-/Computing-related degree programme, or are intending to take only one Science subject (Physics / Chemistry).

## What will I learn in H2 Computing at NYJC?

We cover 5 broad Computing-related areas in the course of the two-year programme:

1. Programming
2. Data Principles
3. Algorithms and Data Structures
4. Computer Networks
5. Computers and Society

We take a hands-on approach to learning. Students carry out tasks in practical lessons, then learn the theory behind what they just did. They will progressively write programs of greater complexity, moving from individual work to pair programming, and finally to a team context.

Their learning experience is capped off with a Summary Project in JC1, and a Capstone Project in JC2.

## What will be covered in the diagnostic test? Am I disadvantaged if I do not have any background in programming?

The diagnostic test assesses dispositions towards complex tasks, and does not require any background in programming or computing. Problems are designed as questions and puzzles to provide a context for computational thinking and problem solving under time pressure.

Submissions are assessed on the following demonstrated abilities and dispositions:

- **Pattern recognition** — spot and exploit patterns in the problem
- **Problem decomposition** — analyse the problem and breaks it down into parts
- **Solution composition** — compose a solution from provided pieces
- **Logical deduction** — draw logical conclusions from given evidence
