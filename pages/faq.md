## Do I need to take H2 Computing to study Computer Science at university?

No autonomous university in Singapore strictly requires H2 Computing for admission. That means you can apply for admission even without H2 Computing.
You can refer to the admissions websites of the universities for further information:

{% for uni in site.data.links.admissions %}
- [{{uni | first}}]({{uni | last}}){% endfor %}

## What is the H2 Computing A Level examination like?
## What will I learn in H2 Computing at NYJC?

Our [Syllabus](/syllabus) page covers the exam syllabus, our approach to lessons, and the topics covered in JC1 and JC2.

## Why would I want to take H2 Computing as a subject?

H2 Computing is not required for admission to any university degree programme. In the JAE system, it also counts as a science stream subject.

Hence, most students in NYJC who take Computing are either firmly determined to take a Math-/Computing-related degree programme, or are intending to take only one Science subject (Physics / Chemistry).

## What will be covered in the diagnostic test? Am I disadvantaged if I do not have any background in programming?

The diagnostic test assesses dispositions towards complex tasks, and does not require any background in programming or computing. Problems are designed as questions and puzzles to provide a context for computational thinking and problem solving under time pressure.

Submissions are assessed on the following demonstrated abilities and dispositions:

- **Decomposition** — Breaking problems into manageable parts
- **Composition** — Integrating parts into coherent solutions
- **Structural Recognition** — Seeing common patterns across different contexts
- **State Reasoning** — Tracking how state changes through a process
