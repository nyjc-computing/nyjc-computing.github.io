# Exam Syllabus

## A Level H2 Computing (Syllabus 9569)

The exam syllabus for all A level subjects can be found on [SEAB's website](https://www.seab.gov.sg/gce-a-level/school-candidates/).

The current syllabus for H2 Computing is 9569 ([{{site.data.links["current-syllabus"]["year"]}}]({{site.data.links["current-syllabus"]["url"]}})). Note that there is no H1 or H3 Computing subject.

There are two papers. Paper 1 is a 3-hr written paper. Paper 2 is a 3-hr lab-based paper, administered digitally on a laptop without internet access. The code files/submissions are uploaded via an electronic system at the end of the exam.

The A Level H2 Computing syllabus covers the following modules:
- Programming Fundamentals
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Data and Information
- Computer Networks
- Social, Ethical and Security Impact of Computing
- Emerging Technologies

## H2 Computing at NYJC

At NYJC, we cover the above modules with a hands-on approach to learning. Students carry out tasks in practical lessons, then learn the theory behind what they just did. They will progressively write programs of greater complexity, moving from individual work to pair programming, and finally to a team context.

### JC1

- Programming in Python
- Data Representation
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Time Complexity
- J1 Summary Project

### JC2

- Web Programming
- Data Management and Databases
- Machine Learning and AI
- Computer Networks
- Data and Network Security
- Computers and Society
