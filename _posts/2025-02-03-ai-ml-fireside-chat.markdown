# Navigating the Future: AI, Career Insights, and Personal Growth

In a thought-provoking fireside chat, Huikang, a machine learning engineer at Quora, shared invaluable insights with NYJCians. The event, aimed at bridging the gap between academic learning and real-world applications, offered a glimpse into the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and software engineering.

## The Power of AI and Its Limitations

Huikang began by highlighting the current capabilities of AI, particularly in tasks that are easy to describe and evaluate. “AI can help you pass tasks that are easy to describe,” he explained, citing examples like writing essays, solving coding problems, and even tackling math.

However, he was quick to point out that AI still has limitations, especially in tasks that are difficult to describe or require complex decision-making. “You need to be aware of what AI should be responding and what AI should not be responding,” Huikang advised, emphasising the importance of critical thinking in the age of AI.

## Preparing for a Tech Career

One of the most valuable parts of the talk was Huikang’s advice on preparing for a career in technology. He stressed the importance of building and deploying projects, stating, “If you are able to do this, you will be able to make products from few things, which is much better than just doing other things.”

Huikang also encouraged students to look at their seniors and alumni, reverse-engineering their career paths to understand what it takes to succeed. “You need to actually reach out to people,” he emphasised, highlighting the importance of networking and proactive learning.

## Key Takeaways for Students

1. Build and document projects that solve real problems
2. Understand the capabilities and limitations of AI
3. Network and reach out to professionals in your field of interest

## Thank you, Huikang!

As the session concluded, students left with a clearer understanding of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the world of technology and AI. The talk not only provided practical advice but also inspired our students to think critically about their future careers and the role they play in shaping their path.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to Huikang for sharing his expertise and insights, and to all the students who participated in this enlightening session. With the landscape of work potentially about to undergo rapid transformation, events like these play a crucial role in letting our students hear from working professionals who can share their real-world experience and context regarding the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
