Congratulations, Sec 4 class of 2024! You will be receiving your results very soon, and I know some of you will be considering NYJC as one of your options. If you don't know what the H2 Computing subject is about, or have some idea of it but would like to find out more, here are some resources you can look at:

- [A-Level curriculum and subject syllabuses](https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/a-level-curriculum-and-subject-syllabuses) [MOE]
- [Computing (Syllabus 9569)](https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2025-a-level-syllabus/9569_y25_sy.pdf) [SEAB]

For more targetted questions, we will be running an AMA on Reddit and Discord where you can ask more specifically about how we run our Computing programme in NYJC.
