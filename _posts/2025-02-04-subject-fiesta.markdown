Welcome, class of 2025! Tomorrow is the start of a new journey for you, and no doubt you will have questions, some of which may involve Computing as a subject. For starters, you can have a look at the official information on MOE and SEAB's website:

- [A-Level curriculum and subject syllabuses](https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/a-level-curriculum-and-subject-syllabuses) [MOE]
- [Computing (Syllabus 9569)]({{site.data.links["current-syllabus"]["url"]}}) [SEAB]

For more targetted questions, talk to us at the Subject Fiesta booth on Day 1 of Orientation. We will also be running an AMA on Discord during the subject selection period, where you can ask more specific questions about how we run our Computing programme in NYJC, and also talk to current/graduated Computing students.

- Discord AMA: [https://discord.gg/cZbBQcyN](https://discord.gg/cZbBQcyN)

See you soon, and enjoy your time in NYJC!
