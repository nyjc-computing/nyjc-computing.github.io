Welcome to the main page of the NYJC Computing website!

This site was set up to provide more information to current and prospective students of NYJC about the programme structure and opportunities available to them.

This site, along with other ongoing projects, is also structured as an opportunity for our students to learn: they will have the opportunity to make code contributions (called commits) to our existing codebases. In the process, they will learn more about software engineering and programming.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us using the social media icons below the footer.
